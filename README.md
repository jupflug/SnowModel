# SnowModel development: Gravity-drainage snowpack liquid water percolation

### This repository contains developments to the SnowModel distributed model framework (Liston and Elder, 2004) detailed in Pflug et al. (2019). Model developments were focused on liquid water movement in the modeled snowpack and are appropriate for only multilayer simulations. Liquid water movement relies more-heavily on snow temperature than the default model and therefore requires simulations with model forcing at at least 3-hourly timesteps, or more frequent. In addition to developments for liquid water percolation:
