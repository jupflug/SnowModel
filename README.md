# SnowModel development: Gravity-drainage snowpack liquid water percolation

##### This repository contains developments to the SnowModel distributed model framework (Liston and Elder, 2004) detailed in Pflug et al. (2019). Model developments were focused on liquid water movement in the modeled snowpack and are appropriate for only multilayer simulations. Liquid water movement relies more-heavily on snow temperature than the default model and therefore requires simulations with model forcing at at least 3-hourly timesteps, or more frequent. In addition to developments for liquid water percolation:
* An option for the user to explicitly define frozen precipitation (instead of using the default precipitation-phase partition) is included
* The 2-layer model used in Pflug et al. (2019) is included 

### Users are cautioned that the developments here are not yet included in the publicly-available SnowModel source code. Differences in model versions are possible. Users are encouraged to inquire about the most-recent model developments and whether the model here is best for their purposes.
